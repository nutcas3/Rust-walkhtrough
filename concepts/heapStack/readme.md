1.    Stack:
      - The stack is a region of memory that stores variables in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.
      - Variables on the stack have a fixed size known at compile time.
      - Access to stack data is faster than heap data because memory allocation and deallocation are simpler.
      - Variables on the stack are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope.
      - Stack memory is limited and typically smaller than heap memory. Exceeding the stack size can lead to a stack overflow.

2.    Heap:
      - The heap is a region of memory where data can be dynamically allocated at runtime.
      - Variables on the heap have a size that may not be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as needed.
      - Access to heap data is slower than stack data because it involves more complex memory allocation and deallocation mechanisms.
      - Variables on the heap must be manually deallocated to prevent memory leaks.
      - Heap memory is larger than stack memory and can potentially grow as needed, although excessive allocation and deallocation can lead to fragmentation.

In Rust, stack-allocated variables are the default, and they follow the ownership and borrowing rules enforced by the compiler. 

Heap-allocated data is managed through smart pointers like Box, Rc, and Arc, which handle the memory management and ownership semantics.
