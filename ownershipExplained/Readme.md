In Rust, ownership is a key concept that ensures memory safety and eliminates many common bugs at compile time. It's a core feature of the language and is enforced by the Rust compiler.

Here's a breakdown of ownership in Rust:

    Ownership Rules:
        Each value in Rust has a variable that's its owner.
        There can only be one owner at a time.
        When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.

    Ownership and Scope:
        The scope is a range within the program for which an item is valid.
        When the scope ends, Rust automatically calls the drop function for the variable, which releases the memory associated with it.

    Move Semantics:
        When a value is assigned to another variable or passed to a function, it's moved.
        The original variable loses ownership of the value.
        This ensures that there's always exactly one owner for each value.

    Borrowing:
        Borrowing allows you to temporarily use a value without taking ownership.
        Borrowing can be either mutable or immutable.
        Mutable borrows (&mut) allow modification of the borrowed value, but only one mutable borrow is allowed at a time to prevent data races.
        Immutable borrows (&) allow read-only access to the borrowed value and can have multiple immutable borrows simultaneously.

    References and Lifetimes:
        References are another way to pass data without taking ownership.
        References are indicated by the & symbol.
        Lifetimes ensure that references are valid for as long as they are used.
